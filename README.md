This specification provides guidance to the OpenC2 implementation
community for issuing commands and parsing responses to hardware
or software that can control administrative policies regarding
network packets.

### :twisted_rightwards_arrows: Repository Organization :twisted_rightwards_arrows:

![branches](images/repo-branches.png)

OpenC2 work product repositories are organized a bit differently
than typical open source software project repositories:

* The **Published** (default) branch represents the current,
  stable, approved version of the work product. If the product
  hasn't progressed past an [OASIS Committee Specification Draft
  (CSD)](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process-2017-05-26/#committeeDraft),
  this branch is essentially empty
* The **Working** branch is where all work-in-progress content is
  captured, and is the place to go for the [current working
  version](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-ap-pf/blob/working/oc2pf.md)
  of this work product

More information about the TC's repository organizing conventions
and branching strategy can be found in our [Documentation
Norms](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-tc-ops/blob/main/Documentation-Norms.md#433-configure-repository).

###  :left_speech_bubble: Description  :left_speech_bubble:

This repository is for a packet filtering actuator profile. Actuator profiles identify the aspects of the OpenC2 language specification that are mandatory and/or meaningful in the context of a given actuator. Actuator Profiles also identify specifiers and options that are unique to the actuator. This repository will focus on the use of OpenC2 to issue commands and parse responses to hardware or software that can control administrative policies regarding network packets.

Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable the command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation.

OASIS TC GitHub repositories, as described in [GitHub Repositories for OASIS TC Members' Chartered Work](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/tcadmin/github-repositories-for-oasis-tc-members-chartered-work), are governed by the OASIS [TC Process](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process), [IPR Policy](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr), and other policies. While they make use of public GitHub repositories, these repositories are distinct from [OASIS Open Repositories](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories), which are used for development of open source [licensed](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/licenses) content.

## Description

Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible
language to enable the command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation. Endpoint detection and response technologies provide a means for continuous monitoring and analysis to more readily identify, detect, and prevent advanced threats. 

This OpenC2 Actuator Profile defines the Actions, Targets, Specifiers and Options that are consistent with the version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification ([OpenC2-Lang-v1.0]) in the context of command and control of various endpoint detection and response technologies.
