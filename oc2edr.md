#### Abstract:
An 'Endpoint Detection and Response' (EDR) system is a security mechanism which identifies malicious behaviors by recording system activities and comparing them to sets of signatures or heuristics. EDR systems facilitate in digital forensics and incident response by storing and indexing said events, and provide functionality to respond to security incidents as they pertain to actively exploited, infected or vulnerable endpoints.

This actuator profile defines the OpenC2 Actions, Targets, Arguments, and Specifiers along with conformance clauses to enable the operation of OpenC2 Producers and Consumers in the context of the response functionalities found in EDR technologies. It covers the ability to respond to incidents by facilitating the containment of devices and files, stopping and restarting devices, denying devices from communicating with or storing files, IPv4-, IPv6- and domain name addresses using atomic indicators, the manipulation of files, registry entries, services and user accounts, and the initialization of anti-malware scans.

Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is an effort to rigorously standardize command and control of vital cyber defense systems. OpenC2 is a concise and extensible language to enable the command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation.

# 1 Introduction

_The content in this section is non-normative, except where it is marked normative._

**Note:** This Actuator profile is consistent with Version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification [\[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0\]](#openc2-lang-v1.0).

OpenC2 is a suite of specifications that enables command and control of cyber defense systems and components. OpenC2 typically uses a request-response paradigm where a Command is encoded by a Producer (managing application) and transferred to a Consumer (managed device or virtualized function) using a secure transfer protocol, and the Consumer acts on the request and responds with status and any other requested information.

This Actuator profile specifies the set of Actions, Targets, Specifiers, and Command Arguments that integrates the response functionalities of EDR systems with the Open Command and Control (OpenC2) Command set. Through this Command set, cyber security orchestrators may gain visibility into and provide control over the ER functionality in a manner that is independent of the instance of the EDR solution.

All components, devices and systems that provide ER functionality MUST implement the OpenC2 Actions, Targets, Specifiers and Arguments identified as required in this document.

Though cyber defense components, devices, systems and/or instances may implement multiple Actuator profiles, a particular OpenC2 Message may reference at most a single Actuator profile. The scope of this document is limited to ER.

The purpose of this document is to:

* Identify the required and optional OpenC2 Actions for Actuators with ER functionality
* Identify the required and optional Target types for each Action in the ER class of Actuators
* Identify Actuator-Specifiers and Arguments for each Action/Target pair that are applicable and/or unique to the ER class of Actuators
* Annotate each Action/Target pair with a justification and example, and provide sample OpenC2 Commands to a ER with corresponding Responses

This ER profile:

* Does not define or implement Actions beyond those defined in Version 1.0 of the [[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0]](#openc2-lang-v10)
* Is consistent with Version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification

Cyber defense systems that are utilizing OpenC2 may require the following components to implement the ER profile:

* OpenC2 Producers: Devices that send Commands, receive Responses, and manage the execution of Commands involving one or more ER or other Actuators with ER capability. The OpenC2 Producer needs _a prior_ knowledge of which Commands the Actuator can process and execute, therefore must understand the profiles for any device that it intends to command
* OpenC2 Consumers: Devices or instances that provide endpoint detection and response functions. Typically these are Actuators that execute the cyber defense function, but could be orchestrators (i.e., a device or instance that forwards Commands to the Actuator)

## 1.1 Changes from earlier versions
This is the initial version of this specifciation.

## 1.2 Glossary

### 1.2.1 Definitions of terms
_This section is normative._

- **Action**: The task or activity to be performed (e.g., 'deny').

- **Actuator**: The function performed by the Consumer that executes the Command (e.g., 'Endpoint Response').

- **Argument**: A property of a Command that provides additional information on how to perform the Command, such as date/time, periodicity, duration, etc.

- **Command**: A Message defined by an Action-Target pair that is sent from a Producer and received by a Consumer.

- **Consumer**: A managed device / application that receives Commands. Note that a single device / application can have both Consumer and Producer capabilities.

- **Message**: A content- and transport-independent set of elements conveyed between Consumers and Producers.

- **Producer**: A manager application that sends Commands.

- **Response**: A Message from a Consumer to a Producer acknowledging a Command or returning the requested resources or status to a previously received Command.

- **Specifier**: A property or field that identifies a Target or Actuator to some level of precision.

- **Target**: The object of the Action, i.e., the Action is performed on the Target (e.g., device).

- **Agent**: A utility or suite of utilities with the capability to carry out EDR response functionalities on devices where the Agent is present and operational.

- **Endpoint**: A computing device capable of executing code and communicating with networks (e.g., desktop or laptop computers, servers, mobile devices). Use of this term within this Actuator Profile implies that the Endpoint has an Agent present and operational on it.

### 1.2.3 Document Conventions
#### 1.2.3.1 Naming Conventions
- [[RFC2119]](#rfc2119)/[[RFC8174]](#rfc8174) key words are in all uppercase.

- All property names and literals are in lowercase, except when referencing canonical names defined in another standard (e.g., literal values from an IANA registry).

- Words in property names are separated with an underscore (_), while words in string enumerations and type names are separated with a hyphen (-).

- The term "hyphen" used here refers to the ASCII hyphen or minus character, which in Unicode is "hyphen-minus", U+002D.

#### 1.2.3.2 Font Colors and Style
The following color, font and font style conventions are used in this document:

* A fixed width font is used for all type names, property names, and literals.
* Property names are in bold style â **'created_at'**.
* All examples in this document are expressed in JSON. They are in fixed width font, with straight quotes, black text and a light shaded background, and 4-space indentation. JSON examples in this document are representations of JSON Objects. They should not be interpreted as string literals. The ordering of object keys is insignificant. Whitespace before or after JSON structural characters in the examples are insignificant [[RFC8259]](#rfc8259).
* Parts of the example may be omitted for conciseness and clarity. These omitted parts are denoted with ellipses (...).

Example:

```json
{
    "action": "deny",
    "target": {
        "file": {
            "hashes": {
                "sha256": "22fe72a34f006ea67d26bb7004e2b6941b5c3953d43ae7ec24d41b1a928a6973"
            }
        }
    }

This section defines the set of Actions, Targets, Specifiers, and Arguments that are meaningful in the context of Endpoint Response (ER). This section also describes the appropriate format for the status and properties of a Response frame. This section is organized into three major subsections; Command Components, Response Components and Commands.

Extensions to the Language Specification are defined in accordance with [[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0]](#openc2-lang-v10), Section 3.1.5, where:

1. The unique name of the ER schema is `oasis-open.org/openc2/v1.0/ap-er`
2. The namespace identifier (nsid) referring to the ER schema is:  `er`
3. The definitions and conformance requirements for these types are contained in this document

## 2.1 OpenC2 Command Components
The components of an OpenC2 Command include Actions, Targets, Actuators and associated Arguments and Specifiers. Appropriate aggregation of the components will define a Command-body that is meaningful in the context of an ER.

This specification identifies the applicable components of an OpenC2 Command. The components of an OpenC2 Command include:

* Action:  A subset of the Actions defined in the OpenC2 Language Specification that are meaningful in the context of an ER.
    * This profile SHALL NOT define Actions that are external to Version 1.0 of the [OpenC2 Language Specification](#openc2-lang-v10)
    * This profile MAY augment the definition of the Actions in the context of an ER
    * This profile SHALL NOT define Actions in a manner that is inconsistent with version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification
* Target:  A subset of the Targets and Target-Specifiers defined in Version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification that are meaningful in the context of ER and three Targets (and their associated Specifiers) that are defined in this specification
* Arguments:  A subset of the Arguments defined in the Language Specification and a set of Arguments defined in this specification
* Actuator:  A set of specifiers defined in this specification that are meaningful in the context of ER

### 2.1.1 Actions
Table 2.1.1-1 presents the OpenC2 Actions defined in Version 1.0 of the Language Specification which are meaningful in the context of an ER Actuator. The combinations of Action/Target pairs that are valid for Endpoint Response purposes are presented in [Section 2.3](#23-openc2-commands).

### 2.1.5 Actuator Specifiers
An Actuator is the entity that provides the functionality and performs the Action. The Actuator executes the Action on the Target. In the context of this profile, the Actuator is the ER and the presence of one or more Specifiers further refine which Actuator(s) shall execute the Action.

**Type: Actuator (Choice)**

| ID   | Name    | Type             | \# | Description                                            |
|------|---------|------------------|----|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 1027 | **er/** | er:AP-Specifiers | 1  | Actuator function and specifiers for Endpoint Response |

The Actuator Specifiers defined in this document are referenced under the `er` namespace.

## 2.2 OpenC2 Response Components
Response messages originate from the Actuator as a result of a Command.

Responses associated with required Actions MUST be implemented. Implementations that include optional Actions MUST implement the RESPONSE associated with the implemented Action. Additional details regarding the Commands and associated Responses are captured in [Section 2.3](#23-openc2-commands). Examples are provided in [Annex A](#annex-a-sample-commands).

### 2.2.1 Response Status Codes
Table 2.2.1-1 lists the Response Status Codes defined in the OpenC2 Language Specification that are applicable to ER.

**Table 2.2.1-1. Response Status Codes**

**_Type: Status-Code (Enumerated.ID)_**

| Value | Description |

## 2.3 OpenC2 Commands

An OpenC2 Command consists of an Action/Target pair and associated Specifiers and Arguments. This section enumerates the allowed Commands and presents the associated Responses.

Table 2.3-2 defines the Commands that are valid in the context of the ER profile. An Action (the top row in Table 2.3-2) paired with a Target (the first column in Table 2.3-2) defines a valid Command. The subsequent subsections provide the property tables applicable to each OpenC2 Command.

**Table 2.3-1. Command Matrix**

Table 2.3-2 defines the Command Arguments that are allowed for a particular Command by the ER profile. A Command (the top row in Table 2.3-2) paired with an Argument (the first column in Table 2.3-2) defines an allowable combination. The subsection identified at the intersection of the Command/Argument provides details applicable to each Command as influenced by the Argument.

A Command where the Target portion of the Action/Target pair is not specified (written as _target_), denotes that the Argument can be combined with all Commands covered by the Action.

This list shall be initially compiled by the Chair, and any Member of the TC may add or remove their names from the list by request. Remove this note before submitting for publication.

## B.1 Participants

<!-- A TC can determine who they list here, however, TC Observers must not be listed. It is common practice for TCs to list everyone that was part of the TC during the creation of the document, but this is ultimately a TC decision on who they want to list and not list. -->

The following individuals have participated in the creation of this specification and are gratefully acknowledged:

# Appendix D: Sample Commands

_This section is non-normative_

This section will summarize and provide examples of OpenC2 Commands as they pertain to er systems. The sample Commands will be encoded in verbose JSON.

## A.1 deny, contain and allow

### A.1.1 Ban a binary by hash on every Endpoint

**Command:**

```json
{
  "action": "deny",
  "target": {
    "file": {
      "hashes": {
        "sha256": "0a73291ab5607aef7db23863cf8e72f55bcb3c273bb47f00edf011515aeb5894"
      }
    }
  },

  }
}
```
**Responses:**

Case One: the Actuator successfully issued the deny.

```json
{
  "status": 200
}
```

Case Two: the Command failed due to a syntax error in the Command. Optional status text is ignored by the Producer, but may be added to provide error details for debugging or logging.

```json
{
  "status": 400,
  "status_text": "Validation Error: Target: flie"
}
```

Case Three: the Command failed because an Argument was not supported.

```json
{
  "status": 501
}
```
